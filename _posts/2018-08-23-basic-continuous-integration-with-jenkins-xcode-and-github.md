In my last article, I made the case for why unit tests and code reviews are valuable. In this one, Iâ€™m going to show you how to set up an automated system to enforce those principles. Before allowing a PR to be merged, weâ€™re going to require someone to review it and that all unit tests have passed.

Shouldnâ€™t developers be running unit tests before submitting a PR? Yes, but thereâ€™s no shame in having guard rails. Itâ€™s common for experts to forget a detail or two. [Look at what happened when a hospital started allowing nurses to enforce checklists on doctors.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist)
> In 2001, a critical-care specialist at Johns Hopkins Hospital named Peter Pronovost decided to give [the checklist] a tryâ€¦he and his team persuaded the hospital administration to authorize nurses to stop doctors if they saw them skipping a step on the checklistâ€¦
> Pronovost and his colleagues monitored what happened for a year afterward. The results were so dramatic that they werenâ€™t sure whether to believe them: **the ten-day line-infection rate went from eleven per cent to zero.** So they followed patients for fifteen more months. Only two line infections occurred during the entire period. They calculated that, in this one hospital, **the checklist had prevented forty-three infections and eight deaths, and saved two million dollars in costs**.

Since errors are likely, why not account for them? We can tell the computer to enforce a checklist of our own design.

There are 3 main parts to make this happen:

* Set up Jenkins to build and test an iOS app

* Get GitHub to hook into Jenkins to trigger builds and report test results

* Configure GitHub to block a PR until all checks pass

## Step 1: Set up Jenkins to build and test an iOS app

Youâ€™re gonna need Jenkins to be running on a Mac. If you canâ€™t do that, bail now. ðŸ‘‹

Jenkins has a ton of plugins to make your life easier. The ones we want are:

* GitHub, GitHub API, GitHub Authentication, and GitHub Pull Request Builder â€” for interacting with GitHub

* JUnit â€” to report unit test results

* Xcode Integration â€” to help us build our iOS app

To install plugins, go to the Home Page -&gt; Manage Jenkins -&gt; Manage Plugins. Then check the Available / Installed Tab. You might already have some of these installed!

First, letâ€™s build our app. Make a **Freestyle job, **then input your repo URL and credentials and specify your main branch:

![](/assets/images/basic-continuous-integration-with-jenkins-xcode-and-github/1INwx0RbA1FRLpUwSK78lrg.png)

Next, cruise on down to the Xcode section and put these in for the general settings. What this plugin does is run `xcodebuild` in your project and makes it easy to configure parameters.

![Itâ€™s good manners to clean before building](/assets/images/basic-continuous-integration-with-jenkins-xcode-and-github/11UIVx-_mgl5gBGeutqE-Xg.png)

Now go to **Advanced Xcode build options -&gt; Advanced build settings**

![](/assets/images/basic-continuous-integration-with-jenkins-xcode-and-github/1tRHkcDeJD-t5EtfLZ8meTQ.png)

See that â€˜destinationâ€™ parameter? Thatâ€™s pointing to the particular device you want to test on. To get a list of devices available, run the following command in your terminal:

{% highlight powershell %}
xcrun simctl list
{% endhighlight %}

I ran into an issue where my build server wasnâ€™t updated yet. My app specified a deployment target of 11.4, but the devices on the server only supported 11.3. Changing the parameter to 11.3 wonâ€™t affect the build if .xcodeproj says you require 11.4 â€” (the answer is to not require such a high deployment target).

Make sure everything is working by clicking â€˜Build Nowâ€™ on your job.

Weâ€™re doing that first because Jenkins gets mad if you try to specify the `test-reports` folder before it exists. Now go down to **Post-build Actions **and add a **Publish JUnit test results report**. Enter `test-reports/*.xml`

![JUnit, not GUnit](/assets/images/basic-continuous-integration-with-jenkins-xcode-and-github/1ARbDNcsfqxapnM9xHX4R8A.png)

Well done! Jenkins is all set up to test your app!

## Step 2: Get GitHub communicating with Jenkins

Remember how we told Jenkins to look for our `master` branch back in step 1? To play nice with GitHub, we want to tell it to look at all of the PR branches. Go back to the **Source Code Management.** Put `origin` in the â€˜Nameâ€™ (remote name) and `+refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*`in the â€˜Refspecâ€™. (Youâ€™ll have to click on â€˜Advancedâ€™ to open this section up.) Finally, be sure to remove `master` from the branch specifier.

Under **Build Triggers**, select GitHub Pull Request Builder

![](/assets/images/basic-continuous-integration-with-jenkins-xcode-and-github/1sol0gDjq1A5IXxTtd1mIXA.png)

And under the **Trigger Setup**, add **Update commit status during build** and put in whatever label you want. (I chose â€˜Unit Testsâ€™)

![](/assets/images/basic-continuous-integration-with-jenkins-xcode-and-github/11T816XBR4wONaaglRdqQlQ.png)

Now itâ€™s time to leave Jenkins and head over to GitHub. Assuming you have admin access, navigate to **Settings -&gt; Hooks **in your repo. Whatâ€™s really cool about GitHub is you can tell them to POST some JSON to wherever you like based on events taking place inside your repo. For example, you could receive a payload after every comment on your PR!

What we care about is running tests when code gets pushed. To do that, click â€˜**Add webhook**â€™ and enter *https://your-jenkins-server.com/[github-webhook/](https://git.target.com/SeanBerry/jenkins-test/settings/hooks/145421)*

![](/assets/images/basic-continuous-integration-with-jenkins-xcode-and-github/1NyY0i1cmm5hQ7lh5zApnqQ.png)

GitHub will send out a ping event to make sure your Jenkins server exists. Make sure it does! Thereâ€™s no point in continuing if GitHub canâ€™t communicate with Jenkins.

If you find yourself doubting if GitHub is actually trying to send events, go back to your **Web Hook** and look at the bottom. It lists out which events were sent and shows you the payload (by clicking on â€˜â€¦â€™) â€” very handy for debugging.

Now letâ€™s test it out!

Create a new branch on your repo and push to GitHub. You should see a new payload in â€˜Recent Deliveriesâ€™ (shown above) and see Jenkins kick off a build. Sometimes Jenkins can be a little slow to get going, so give it a couple minutes before declaring everything is busted.

## Step 3: Configure GitHub to block a PR until all checks pass

The final step is the easiest.

You can â€˜protectâ€™ a branch â€” which disallows merging until certain requirements are met.

Go into your repoâ€™s **Settings -&gt; Branches** and choose a branch to protect.

![We specified that status check in Jenkins](/assets/images/basic-continuous-integration-with-jenkins-xcode-and-github/1tCVjfaNWkDjU2A7NU_THFA.png)

I like to require at least 1 reviewer, require the branch be up to date, and have all unit tests pass. You can always override and force a merge as an administrator if you really want to (pro-tip: donâ€™t do it).

![Now to find someone to review my â€˜Test please ignoreâ€™ PRâ€¦](/assets/images/basic-continuous-integration-with-jenkins-xcode-and-github/1s6xhXOWKvl2nsyPjfzU-nA.png)

Your master branch is now protected, and youâ€™re safe from easily made mistakes. Thank you GitHub/Jenkins for keeping us honest.
